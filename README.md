# Advanced RAG Patterns with Mixtral on SageMaker Jumpstart

Example Jupyter Notebook of [Mixtral 8x7B Instruct](https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1) and [BGE Large En](https://huggingface.co/BAAI/bge-large-en) to experiment Advanced Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) QnA systems on a SageMaker Notebook using [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/).

## :books: Background

[Amazon SageMaker](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/) is a fully managed service for data science and machine learning (ML) workflows.
You can use Amazon SageMaker to simplify the process of building, training, and deploying ML models.

The [SageMaker example notebooks](https://sagemaker-examples.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) are Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate the usage of Amazon SageMaker.

The [Sagemaker Example Community repository](https://github.com/aws/amazon-sagemaker-examples-community) are additional notebooks, beyond those critical for showcasing key SageMaker functionality, can be shared and explored by the commmunity.


## :hammer_and_wrench: Setup

The quickest setup to run example notebooks includes:
- An [AWS account](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/gs-account.html)
- Proper [IAM User and Role](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/authentication-and-access-control.html) setup
- An [Amazon SageMaker Notebook Instance](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/gs-setup-working-env.html)
